        <p>i am studying business management and marketing and i am currently taking this class, professional sales, and business fundamentals as well as a few others. I want to eventually get into sales and advertising. I love to play pickleball, spikeball, sand volleyball, disc Golf as well as thrifting, and hottubbing </p>
        <p>I am currently working at a car wash in lehi utah that just opened up this week and i work on the express interior detail and i enjoy it a lot because I love cars and i think its pretty satisfying and not stressful.  </p>
        <p>I recently returned from my mission in the Idaho pocatello mission and I loved it so much! i miss the people there and being a missionary but am so excited for the rest of my life and the opportunities that it will bring. I have three younger sisters and live with some mission friedns in orem utah. I am originally from Gilbert Arizona.  </p>
